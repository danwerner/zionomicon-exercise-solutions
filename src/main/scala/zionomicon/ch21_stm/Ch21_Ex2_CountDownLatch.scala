/**
 * Implement a simple countdown latch using ZIO STMâ€™s TRef. A countdown latch
 * starts with a specified count (n). It provides two primary operations:
 *
 *   - countDown: Decrements the count by one but does nothing if it is already zero.
 *   - await: Suspends the calling fiber until the count reaches zero, allowing it to
 *     proceed only after all countdowns have been completed.
 *
 * Note: This exercise is for educational purposes to help you understand the basics of
 * STM. ZIO already provides a CountDownLatch implementation with more basic
 * concurrency primitives.
